# Pokétch-os

Pokétch-os is a fork of [wasp-os](https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os), an open source firmware for nRF52-based smart watches. It reskins watch applications to emulate those found in the [Pokétch](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9tch), a digital watch given to players in the 4th generation Pokémon games.

Currently, I've only themed the digital watch and stopwatch applications. Now that I've got my feet wet with smart watch development, in the future I'd like to expand on this project and create my own apps in the spirit of those found in the game.
